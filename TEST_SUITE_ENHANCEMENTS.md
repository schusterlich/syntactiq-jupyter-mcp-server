# Test Suite Enhancements for Jupyter MCP Server

## Overview

I've significantly expanded the testing coverage for the Jupyter MCP Server with comprehensive edge cases, worst-case scenarios, and unit tests. The testing is now split into two complementary suites:

## 📋 Enhanced MCP Test Suite (`mcp_test_suite.py`)

### New Test Categories Added:

#### 1. **Connection Resilience & Recovery**
- Tests connection stability under stress
- Rapid consecutive operations 
- Connection recovery scenarios
- Stress testing with concurrent requests

#### 2. **Large Data Handling**
- Very long cell content (500+ Lorem ipsum repetitions)
- Large output generation (100+ lines)
- Many cells scenarios (20+ cells at once)
- Memory usage validation

#### 3. **Execution Edge Cases**
- Syntax error handling (`print('missing quote)`)
- Runtime error handling (ZeroDivisionError)
- Long-running operations with timeouts
- Memory-intensive operations

#### 4. **Invalid Input Handling**
- Invalid cell indices (negative, out-of-bounds)
- Empty and whitespace-only content
- Special characters and Unicode (🚀💻😀 αβγδ ∑∫∞)
- Extremely long strings (10k+ characters)

#### 5. **Concurrent Operations**
- Simultaneous cell additions (5 concurrent)
- Simultaneous read operations (20 concurrent)
- Mixed concurrent operations (reads + writes + executions)
- Race condition detection

#### 6. **Notebook Switching Edge Cases**
- Switch to non-existent notebooks
- Invalid path characters (`<>:"|?*`)
- Operations during context switches
- Notebook creation edge cases

### Usage:
```bash
python mcp_test_suite.py
```

## 🧪 New Unit Test Suite (`unit_test_suite.py`)

### Test Categories:

#### 1. **Output Extraction Tests**
- Basic string extraction
- Stream format handling
- Execute result processing
- Error format parsing
- Unknown format handling

#### 2. **ANSI Code Stripping**
- Basic ANSI color removal
- Complex ANSI sequences
- Performance validation

#### 3. **Text Truncation Logic**
- Short text (no truncation)
- Long text (1500+ chars)
- Extreme length (50k+ chars, safety limits)
- Full output vs truncated modes

#### 4. **Base64 Image Detection**
- JSON format detection (`{"image/png":"..."}`)
- Raw format detection (PNG/JPEG signatures)
- False positive avoidance
- Data URL format handling

#### 5. **Image Information Extraction**
- PNG extraction with metadata
- Multiple format support (JPEG, SVG)
- Missing image handling
- Structured data validation

#### 6. **Safe Output Processing**
- List processing
- Error handling with malformed data
- Text/image separation
- CRDT object simulation

#### 7. **Mock Object Compatibility**
- CRDT Text object simulation
- Mock object with `to_py()` method
- Image data with `source` attribute

#### 8. **Edge Cases & Boundary Conditions**
- Empty/None inputs
- Malformed data structures
- Circular reference handling
- Configuration validation

### Usage:
```bash
python unit_test_suite.py
```

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### **Coverage Expansion**
- **Before**: ~15 test cases covering basic functionality
- **After**: ~55+ test cases covering edge cases, stress scenarios, and unit validation

### **Bulletproof Synchronization Testing**
- All new tests use the improved synchronization that waits for actual completion
- Retry-based verification for state changes
- Proper handling of race conditions

### **Real-World Scenario Testing**
- Unicode and special character handling
- Large data scenarios that could occur in production
- Concurrent usage patterns
- Error recovery scenarios

### **Isolated Component Testing**
- Unit tests validate utility functions independently
- Mock object compatibility for CRDT structures
- Edge case validation for all helper functions

## 🚀 Running the Complete Test Suite

### For Full Coverage:
```bash
# Run unit tests first (fast, isolated, no cleanup needed)
python unit_test_suite.py

# Then run comprehensive MCP tests (requires services, includes automatic cleanup)
python mcp_test_suite.py
```

### 🧹 Automatic Cleanup System

The MCP test suite now includes **comprehensive automatic cleanup** to prevent test chaos:

#### **What Gets Cleaned Up:**
- ✅ **Test Cells**: Removes all cells created during testing, restoring to initial count
- ✅ **Test Notebooks**: Deletes all notebooks created during testing using Jupyter Contents API
- ✅ **Notebook Context**: Restores original notebook context if changed during testing
- ✅ **Graceful Failure**: Cleanup attempts continue even if some operations fail

#### **How It Works:**
1. **Initial State Capture**: Records cell count and current notebook before testing
2. **Artifact Tracking**: Tracks every notebook created during tests
3. **Automatic Cleanup**: Runs cleanup in `finally` block (always executes)
4. **Verification**: Confirms cleanup success and reports any issues

#### **Cleanup Output Example:**
```
Test Cleanup
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🧹 Cleaning up test cells...
🧹 Removing 47 test cells (from 52 to 5)
✅ Cell cleanup completed: 5 cells remaining
🧹 Cleaning up 3 test notebooks...
✅ Deleted notebook: test_notebook_abc123.ipynb
✅ Deleted notebook: switch_test_def456.ipynb  
✅ Deleted notebook: switch_test_ghi789.ipynb
🧹 Restoring original notebook context: notebook.ipynb
✅ Original notebook context restored
🎉 All test artifacts cleaned up successfully!
```

### Test Statistics:
- **Unit Tests**: ~25 test methods across 9 test classes
- **MCP Integration Tests**: ~30+ test methods across 12 categories
- **Total Coverage**: Output extraction, truncation, image handling, connection resilience, large data, execution errors, concurrency, and more

## 🔧 What These Tests Catch

### **Production Issues Prevented**:
1. **Memory exhaustion** from large outputs
2. **Connection timeouts** under load
3. **Unicode encoding** problems
4. **Race conditions** in concurrent usage
5. **Error handling** failures
6. **Image data** processing issues
7. **State corruption** during switching
8. **Input validation** bypasses

### **Performance Validation**:
- Truncation efficiency under extreme loads
- Connection stability under stress
- Memory usage with large datasets
- Concurrent operation handling

## 🔧 Benefits of the Cleanup System

### **Prevents Test Chaos**
- **Before**: Tests would create 50+ cells and multiple notebooks, cluttering workspace
- **After**: Returns to pristine initial state after every test run
- **Result**: Can run tests repeatedly without accumulating artifacts

### **Professional Testing**
- **Isolated Test Runs**: Each run starts from clean state
- **No Side Effects**: Tests don't affect each other or workspace
- **Production Ready**: Mimics proper CI/CD testing practices

### **Developer Friendly**
- **No Manual Cleanup**: Automatic removal of all test artifacts
- **Clear Feedback**: Shows exactly what was cleaned up
- **Graceful Failure**: Reports cleanup issues without breaking tests

### **Examples of Cleanup Prevention**
```bash
# Before cleanup system - after multiple test runs
$ ls notebooks/
notebook.ipynb  test_notebook_abc123.ipynb  test_notebook_def456.ipynb
switch_test_ghi789.ipynb  switch_test_jkl012.ipynb  test_notebook_mno345.ipynb

# After cleanup system - clean workspace maintained
$ ls notebooks/
notebook.ipynb  
```

## 🚀 Perfect for CI/CD

The cleanup system makes the test suite perfect for **continuous integration**:
- ✅ **Repeatable**: Multiple runs don't interfere with each other  
- ✅ **Isolated**: No state leakage between test executions
- ✅ **Professional**: Production-grade testing practices
- ✅ **Maintainable**: No manual intervention required

## 🛠️ Manual Cleanup Script (Backup)

For situations where automatic cleanup fails, use the **manual cleanup script**:

```bash
# Check current workspace status
python manual_cleanup.py --status

# Preview what would be cleaned up
python manual_cleanup.py --dry-run

# Clean everything (interactive)
python manual_cleanup.py

# Clean only test notebooks
python manual_cleanup.py --notebooks-only

# Clean only cells (keep 5 cells)
python manual_cleanup.py --cells-only --target-cells 5
```

### **Manual Cleanup Features:**
- 🔍 **Status Check**: Shows notebooks and cell counts
- 🔧 **Dry Run Mode**: Preview cleanup without changes
- 📝 **Notebook Cleanup**: Removes test notebooks by pattern matching
- 🗑️ **Cell Cleanup**: Interactive cell count reduction
- ✅ **Confirmation**: Asks before making changes
- 🎯 **Selective**: Clean notebooks-only or cells-only

These enhancements provide comprehensive validation that your MCP server can handle real-world usage patterns, edge cases, and stress scenarios - all while maintaining a clean testing environment.
