**Jupyter MCP Server** is a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) server implementation that provides interaction with 📓 Jupyter notebooks running in any JupyterLab or Notebook>=7.

This works also with your 💻 local Jupyter and with [Datalayer](https://datalayer.ai/) hosted Notebooks.

## 🚀 Key Features

- ⚡ **Real-time control:** Instantly view notebook changes as they happen.
- 🔁 **Smart execution:** Automatically adjusts when a cell run fails thanks to cell output feedback.
- 🤝 **MCP-Compatible:** Works with any MCP client, such as Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, and more.

🛠️ This MCP offers multiple tools such as `insert_execute_code_cell`, `append_markdown_cell`, `get_notebook_info`, `read_cell`, and more, enabling advanced interactions with Jupyter notebooks. Explore our [tools documentation](https://jupyter-mcp-server.datalayer.tech/tools) to learn about all the tools powering Jupyter MCP Server.

## 🏁 Getting Started

For comprehensive setup instructions—including `Streamable HTTP` transport and advanced configuration—check out [our documentation](https://jupyter-mcp-server.datalayer.tech/). Or, get started quickly with `JupyterLab` and `stdio` transport here below.

### 1. Set Up Your Environment

```bash
pip install jupyterlab==4.4.1 jupyter-collaboration==4.0.2 ipykernel
pip uninstall -y pycrdt datalayer_pycrdt
pip install datalayer_pycrdt==0.12.17
```

### 2. Start JupyterLab

```bash
# make jupyterlab
jupyter lab --port 8888 --IdentityProvider.token MY_TOKEN --ip 0.0.0.0
```

### 3. Configure Your Preferred MCP Client

> [!NOTE]
>
> Ensure the `port` of the `ROOM_URL` and `RUNTIME_URL` match those used in the `jupyter lab` command.
>
> The `ROOM_ID` which is the path to the notebook you want to connect to, should be relative to the directory where JupyterLab was started.
>
> In a basic setup, `ROOM_URL` and `RUNTIME_URL` are the same. `ROOM_TOKEN`, and `RUNTIME_TOKEN` are also the same.
